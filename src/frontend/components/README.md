# Frontend Components

This directory contains reusable UI components for the event planning platform.

## Organization

Components should be organized by feature or functionality:
- Form components (input fields, validation displays)
- Navigation components (navigation bar, links)
- Display components (recommendation cards, lists)
- Chat components (message display, input)
- Layout components (hero section, containers)

## Naming Convention

- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `BudgetInputForm.tsx`)
- Co-locate tests with components using `.test.tsx` suffix
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
