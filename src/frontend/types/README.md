# Frontend Types

This directory contains frontend-specific TypeScript interfaces and types.

## Organization

- Component prop types
- Frontend-specific state types
- UI-specific enums and constants

## Note

For shared types used by both frontend and backend (API contracts, data models), use the `src/shared/types` directory instead.
