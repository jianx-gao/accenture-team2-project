## Future Structure Recommendations
As the project develops, consider organizing by:
- Feature modules (events, venues, budgets, communication)
- Separation of concerns (frontend, backend, shared utilities)
- Clear distinction between business logic and infrastructure code

## Conventions
To be established as codebase grows.
