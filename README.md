Problem 3.1 - Event Planning

Large event venues
    Sports finals
    Major concerts
    Weddings

They require planners to manage complex logistics
    City operations
    Venues
    Attendees
    Ongoing adjustments

These events are hosted by event planners and organisers. These people have issues
    Respondents (reduced budgets for events are an increasing issue)
    Event planners (delayed schedules)
    Surveyed couplets (expectations to afford vs inspiration for planning weddings)
    Planners (difficulties incorporating sustainable practices due to budgets)
    Event organisers (communication was a challenge during event planning)

Current solutions – Event planning apps
    Cvent
    Eventbrite
    Bizzabo
